## Product Vision Statement

This campus-based app allows students to create profiles, connect with like-minded individuals in their classes and majors, and coordinate study sessions through real-time location, shared calendars, and direct messaging.

## User Requirements

1. As a student, I want to meet more peers in my major and year so that I can collaborate on work and make new friends.
2. As a psychology and biology student at NYU, I want to meet other students within my major so that I can meet potential co-workers at Langone.
3. As a private person, I want to make sure my location is secure so that random people using the app can’t see my location.
4. As a new freshman, I want to meet kids in my classes so that I can make friends at a new school.
5. As a senior, I want to meet students going into the same profession as me so that I can meet potential co-workers and connections that will benefit my working life.
6. As a shy student, I want a safe way to start conversations online so that I don’t feel pressure to approach strangers in class.
7. As a confident person, I want to communicate with classmates I already know so that I can set up study groups without waiting to meet them in person.
8. As a student, I want to specify my study habits on my profile so that I can be matched with students with similar methods.
9. As an economics major, I want to find classmates with similar career goals so that I can build my professional network early.
10. As an economics student (Kiamy’s perspective), I want to know that enough people are using the app so that I can reliably find good study matches.
11. As a musician, I want the option to connect online without always meeting in person so that I can collaborate in ways that fit my workflow.
12. As a student in a large lecture, I want an easy way to meet classmates through the app so that I don’t feel lost in a crowd.
13. As a new user, I want to upload my name, photo, and major so that others can quickly learn who I am.
14. As a student, I want to list my favorite study spots so that I can meet others who like the same places.
15. As a curious person, I want to view suggested matches based on my profile info so that I don’t have to search endlessly.
